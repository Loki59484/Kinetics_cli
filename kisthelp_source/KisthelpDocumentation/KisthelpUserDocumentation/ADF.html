<p><b><i><font color="#000000"><font size="+2">II.5 <u>How to generate the KiSThelP input file directly from ADF output</u></font></font></i></b>

<br><br>
After having created a new session (menu Session/New), run a new calculation using the menu Calculation/Atom,Molecule <br>(or
Calculation/k / TST, or . . .) and select your ADF outputfile upon request (.out file extension).
<br><br>

Prior to that, you must run a frequency ADF job to get all necessary data to be read next by KiSThelP. This can be done through <br> the 
ADF integrated graphical user interface: check the checkbox  Frequencies. An .out ADF outputfile will be generated, which can be read by KiSThelP. <br> 


<br><br>
An ADF  parser has been designed to analyze ADF '.out' outputfiles up to release 2024.102. More recent versions might be parsed, but without guarantees.

ADF - KiSThelP OUTPUT DIFFERENCES
</font> <br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br> When comparing KiSThelP thermochemistry analysis with ADF's one, caution: 

<ul>
<li> ADF does not take into account the electronic degeneracy in the calculation of thermal properties, while KiSThelP does. <br> This can be checked by setting 1 in the 'Elec. deg.' field in KiSThelP graphical user interface. 

<li> The default pressure taken by ADF is 1.0 atm. Using KiSThelP you can screen interactively any pressure, but default is 1.0 bar.

<li> The default temperature taken by ADF is 298.15K. Using KiSThelP you can screen interactively any temperature, but default is 298.0K.

<li> Make sure KiSThelP has read the proper ADF Rotational symmetry number. Anyway, this value can be set interactively directly from the graphical interface.
 
<li> WARNING: in addition to the standard harmonic conventional treatment, ADF performs a specific thermochemistry treatment for low vibrational modes:
 <br> a so-called 'low vibrational frequency free rotor
      interpolation correction' is applied according to the paper by S. Grimme (Chem. Eur. J. 2012, 18, 9955-9964) <br> and the ADF output provides the user with both treatments (harmonic and low vibrational frequency free rotor). <br> It is worth noting that in KiSThelP, to account for deviations from the harmonic oscillator,<br> a hindered rotor approach has been implemented  (HRDS treatment, see <a href="molecularSystem.html"> this page</a>). <br> The 'low vibrational frequency free rotor interpolation correction' will be implemented in KiSThelP soon.
    
</ul> <br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<br>
    
All the data used by KiSThelP to get the thermochemistry results can be interactively changed directly from the KiSThelP graphical interface:


<ul>

<li> The Mass (amu).

<li> The potential energy (hartree).

<li> The Electronic degeneracy.

<li> The Rotational Symmetry number.

<li> The inertia moments (a.u.).

<li> The real vib. frequencies (cm-1).

</ul>

Also, a scaling factor applied to vib. frequencies can applied through the KiSThelP graphical interface. Default value in KiSThelP is 1.0.
