Two files are provided:

- kisthelp2025_10_Jan.jar (a runnable java archive)

- kisthelpSRC2025_10_Jan.zip   (the code source together with libraries, sample runs, 
                                documentation, installation instructions)


KiSThelP is a cross-platform open-source application. It is distributed
in the executable jar format. Double-clicking the file <kisthelp2025_10_Jan.jar>
or upon issuing the command <java  kisthelp2025_10_Jan.jar>, the program will start on  Windows, Linux 
and MacOS operating systems.

The source is given separately from the runnable JAR. To access the source, unzip 
kisthelpSRC2025_10_Jan.zip, the files which make up the distribution package will be extracted.

If you published results using KiSThelP, we would appreciate it if you would

thermodynamic properties and rate constants from quantum chemistry results" ,
