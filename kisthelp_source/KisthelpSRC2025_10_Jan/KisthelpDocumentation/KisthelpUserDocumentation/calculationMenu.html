KiSThelP has been designed to perform statistical mechanics calculations from ab initio quantum chemistry data. This results in the computation of canonical partition functions, molecular thermodynamic properties, thermal equilibrium constants, transition state theory (TST) rate coefficients, and RRKM rate coefficients. One-dimensional tunneling and variational effects have also been incorporated in the TST calculations.

It is to be noted that the standard state of pure gaseous species (ideal gas at P<sup>0</sup>=1 bar) is used in chemical equilibrium and TST kinetic properties computations, but the molecular properties calculated with KiSThelP can also be estimated at any pressure. These properties computations clearly have some limitations the user must be aware of. The Born-Oppenheimer and ideal gas approximations are invoked. The electronic partition function is truncated after the first term. Harmonic oscillator and the rigid-rotor approximation are assumed. 
<br><br>
At a given temperature, the data required to derive the vibrational partition functions Q<sub>vib</sub><sup>v=0</sup> from ab initio calculations are the frequencies (&nu;<sub>i</sub>) of vibrational modes obtained within the harmonic oscillator approximation. In calculating the vibrational partition function, vibrational energy is measured from the ground state (v=0). But, we also print out Q<sub>vib</sub><sup>BOT</sup> obtained by choosing the zero of energy to be the bottom of the potential energy curve.  Due to the neglect of anharmonicity in electronic structure computations, it is known that there is a systematic error in the calculated harmonic vibrational frequencies when they are compared to the experimental fundamental vibrational frequencies. A scaling factor is commonly used to correct the calculated value to match the experimental one. KiSThelP gives the possibility to scale harmonic vibrational frequencies by such a factor (directly from the GUI). The harmonic oscillator approximation provides a fast and straightforward method to determine the vibrational frequencies used to compute the partition function of internal modes, but it breaks down for large-amplitude internal motions such as internal rotations. The hindered rotor approximation offers a significant improvement as compared to the harmonic oscillator treatment. That is the reason why the approach of Flagan et al [B. R. McClurg, W. A. Goddard and R. C. Flagan, J. Chem. Phys. 106 (1997) 6675] has been implemented in KiSThelP to account for deviations from the harmonic oscillator (HO) value. The calculations are based on two quantities:
&theta; = k<sub>b</sub>T/h&nu; and r = &Delta;E/h&nu;. The deviations proposed by the authors for the vibrational contributions are:

where the corrections &Delta;U and Q/Q<sub>H</sub>O exclude ZPE contribution and I<sub>x</sub>(r/2&theta;) is the Bessel function of order x. 

The method used (HRDS) is based on an interpolation scheme between quantum-mechanical partition function at low temperature and the classical partition function at high temperature. The only input parameter to HRDS is the ratio of barrier height to harmonic frequency. However, torsions exhibiting multiple-wells energy curves, with conformers favoured over others conformers cannot be well represented by this method.

<br>
<br>
Translational partition function, Q<sub>trans</sub>, only depends on the molecular mass, temperature and pressure in the ideal gas approximation.  For molecules, the moments of inertia derived from the geometry are used as input for calculating the rotational partition function Q<sub>rot</sub>  in the rigid rotor approximation. Three cases are envisaged: single atoms (Q<sub>rot</sub> is set to 1), linear polyatomic molecules, and general non-linear polyatomic molecules.  The rotational symmetry number that compensates for overcounting identical states must be supplied by the user in the input data file. Spacing of electronic energy levels is assumed to be very large compared to k<sub>b</sub>T so that the excited electronic states do not make a significant contribution to the total partition function. The electronic partition then reduces to the degeneracy of the ground state. The energy of the ground state is set to zero. As usually adopted in statistical mechanics for molecules, vibration, translation, rotation and electronic modes are assumed uncoupled. Hence, in KiSThelP, the partition function of a molecule in its ground state is calculated as:  Q<sub>trans</sub> &times; Q<sub>rot</sub> &times; Q<sub>vib</sub>&times; Q<sub>elec</sub>. These statistical calculations provide the bridge between quantum mechanics of individual molecules and resulting thermodynamic properties, which are reported in the output. It should be kept in mind that the absolute enthalpies computed from quantum mechanics are relative to infinitely separated electrons and nuclei. </font>

The equations used for computing statistical and thermochemical data in KiSThelP are from standard texts on thermodynamics (see for example [R.A. Alberty and R. J. Silbey, <i>"Physical Chemistry"</i>,1st edition, Edited by John Wiley & sons, Inc, ]. Formula employed in KiSThelP are <a HREF="formula.html"> here </a>. The starting point in each case (translational, vibrational, rotational) is the partition function Q(V,T) for the corresponding component of the total partition function.
<br>
<br>
In addition to the numerical results (statistical and thermodynamical), the Maxwell-Boltzmann
distribution (N<sub>i</sub>/N) = g(E<sub>i</sub>)exp(-E<sub>i</sub>/k<sub>B</sub>T)/Q is plotted as a function of (E<sub>i</sub>/k<sub>B</sub>T).  E<sub>i</sub> represents energy levels in the translational and ro-vibrational  modes. In practice, the degeneracy g(E<sub>i</sub>) is evaluated as the product N(E<sub>i</sub>) &times; dE<sub>i</sub> using the density of states and a small energy grain dE<sub>i</sub>, respectively. 
N(E<sub>i</sub>) is obtained by convolution using ro_vibrational and translational densities of states (as described by W. Forst [in <i> "Theory of Unimolecular reactions"</i>,   Academic Press, New York, 1973 and <i> "Unimolecular reactions" </i>, Cambridge University Press,2003]. It also includes electronic degeneracy of the ground state. The density of states of vibrations and rotations have been calculated using the Laplace-transform method, which is based on the inversion of the partition function. For translational modes, a semi-classical approach is employed here, rather than the Laplace-transform method.<BR>
<BR>
KiSThelP is an interactive program that allows the user to change input data directly through the GUI. For single molecular system calculations, the user can interactively test the influence of the mass, potential energy, electronic degeneracy, rotational symetry number, inertia moment, vibrational frequencies, on statistical and thermodynamical properties. The "default values" button restores initial values. Also, a "vibrational" scaling factor field is made available. Default value is 1.0, meaning that no scaling factor is applied. Changing to values &le; 1 will multiply each initial frequency by this factor. 

<BR>
<BR>
Similarly, temperature and pressure can be interactively changed from single value to range of values. All the properties are immediately re-computed accounting for new parameters. In the case of a "temperature range" or "pressure range", a 2D-plot is displayed. Selected properties can then be displayed individually.

To determine the reaction path degeneracy &sigma;, thinking about all the various possibilities can rapidly become confusing. Recommended literature are [A. J. Karas, M. A. Collins and R. G.

However, the potential energy along IRC has not always a shape such that the tunneling probability
cannot be usefully approximated by an Eckart potential. Furthermore, although convenient to carry out,and thus attractive, these methods (Wigner and Eckart) do not take into account the full dimensionality of the quantum effect. 
One of the possible extensions of KiSThelP is to program the semi-classical WKB approximation in order to better estimate the permeability P(E), using zero curvature tunneling (ZCT, which does not include corner-cutting tunneling) or event more accurate small-curvature tunneling (SCT) or large curvature tunneling (LCT) approaches.

The thermal rate constants of the unimolecular reactions
are obtained by applying the RRKM theory to predict
the falloff behaviour. The microcanonical rate constants k(E) are calculated by the standard
RRKM expression: <br><br></font>

where &sigma; is the
reaction path degeneracy, G(E) is the total number of states
of the transition state with energy less than or equal to E,
and N(E) is the density of states of the dissociating reactant species. 

Reactant and transition state are approximated as symmetric tops and the external K-rotor,
associated with the smallest moment of inertia, is treated as an
active degree of freedom completely coupled to the vibrations. Laplace-transform method based on the inversion of the partition functions is employed for the calculation of the sum of states G(E) and density of states N(E).
The thermal rate constant is obtained by using the following expression:</font>

where  &sigma; is the reaction path degeneracy, h is the Planck's constant, Q<sub>2</sub> is the partition function of the active degrees of freedom (vibrations + K-rotor)
of the reactant, Q&Dagger;<sub>1</sub> and Q<sub>1</sub> are the partition functions
for adiabatic rotations of the transition state and of the reactant,
respectively, E<sub>0</sub> is the zero-point-corrected threshold energy. The strong collision approximation is used assuming that every collision deactivates with &omega;=&beta;<sub>c</sub>Z<sub>LJ</sub>[M] being
the effective collision frequency where &beta;<sub>c</sub> is the collisional efficiency,
Z<sub>LJ</sub> is the Lennard-Jones collision frequency and [M] is
    the total gas concentration. Z<sub>LJ</sub> are calculated using the Lennard-Jones parameters: &epsilon;/k<sub>b</sub> (K) and &sigma; (cm) according to the equations (3.1) and (3.3) from reference [J. Troe, J. Chem. Phys. 66, 4758 (1977); <a href="http://doi.org/10.1063/1.433838" target=_blank> doi: 10.1063/1.433838 </a>]. Such parameters may be found using the KiSThelP <A href="dataMenu.html#lennarJones">"Data/Lennard-Jones parameters"</a> menu. In order to account for the centrifugal
effect in the rate constant calculation, the factor Q<sup>&Dagger;</sup><sub>1</sub>/Q<sub>1</sub>
was included in the expression of k(T) and k(E) is evaluated
at the energy E including &lt;&Delta;E<sub>j</sub>&gt; with &lt;&Delta;E<sub>j</sub>&gt; = (1- I<sup>&Dagger;</sup>/I)&times; k<sub>b</sub>T 
where I<sup>&Dagger;</sup> and I are the average of the two largest moments of
inertia. It accounts for the release (or uptake) of a certain amount of the rotational energy associated with the external two-dimensional inactive rotation (J) into the active degrees of freedom as the system approach the transition state.  The thermal rate constant is obtained using a 15-point Gauss-Laguerre integration. For the 15 roots of the Laguerre polynomial numerical values of G(E), N(E) and k(E) are given. In addition, the k(E) plot is displayed for energy values up to 100 k<sub>b</sub>T. Low- and high-pressure limits (k<sup>0</sup> and k<sup>&infin;</sup>) are also given. Neither variational theory nor tunneling effect have been implemented in the present version of KiSThelP. This is one of the perspectives for futur KiSThelP developments.</font>

Calculation of gas-phase chemical reaction equilibrium constants

</font></b>
</p>

<p><font size="+1">
The knowledge of equilibrium constants is important in the
study of chemical reaction mechanisms. In addition to allowing
the prediction of the composition of a mixture, the equilibrium
constant is also connected to rate constants through
the existence of equilibrium between stable species in multiplestep
processes. Furthermore, in simulations of gas-phase mixtures,
backward rate can be found using the forward rate and the equilibrium constant.
In other respects, the equilibrium constant is a practical indicator
to test theoretical methods because it is very sensitive both to
the energy quality and to geometrical parameters and also
because the electronic structure of each compound that takes
part in the equilibrium is extremely different from the others.

<br><br>
To compute an equilibrium constant betwen reactant(s) and product(s)for a given balanced equation,stoichiometric coefficients must be supplied. The thermodynamical expression of the equilibrium constant for gas-phase reactions is employed in KiSThelP:
</font><br>
<div style="text-align:center;"> <IMG src="equil.png"  width="147" height="100">  </div> <br>

<font size="+1">
where &Delta;G<sup>0</sup>(T) is the change in standard Gibbs energy. The standard state of a pure gaseous substance is used (ideal gas at one bar pressure).  It is to be noted that non-standard reaction properties (&Delta;H;, &Delta;S, &Delta;G) can be displayed too.                                                                                                                     


Reactants data are obtained from separated electronic structure calculations.


KiSThelP will ask the user for the number of reactants and products in the studied balanced equation. For each species, one data filename and stoechiometric coefficient must be provided.
