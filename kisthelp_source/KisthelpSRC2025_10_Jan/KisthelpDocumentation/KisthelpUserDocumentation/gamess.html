<p><b><i><font color="#000000"><font size="+2">II.2 <u>How to generate the KiSThelP input file directly from Gamess output</u></font></font></i></b>

<br><br>
After having created a new session (menu Session/New), run a new calculation using the menu Calculation/Atom,Molecule <br>(or
Calculation/k / TST, or . . .) and select your gamess outputfile upon request.
<br><br>

Prior to that, you must run a frequency job to get all necessary data to be read next by KiSThelP. This can be done by <br> inserting the
keyword ** RUNTYP=HESSIAN ** in the gamess $CONTRL input section.

<br><br>
A Gamess parser has been designed to analyze Gamess outputfiles up to release Gamess2018. More recent versions might be parsed, but without guarantees.

<br><br>
When comparing KiSThelP thermochemistry analysis with Gamess's one, caution: 

<ul>

<li> The default pressure taken by gamess is 1.0 atm. Using KiSThelP you can screen interactively any pressure, but default is 1.0 bar.

<li> The default temperature taken by gamess is 298.15K. Using KiSThelP you can screen interactively any temperature, but default is 298.0K.

<li> Make sure KiSThelP has read the proper Rotational symmetry number. Anyway, this value can be changed interactively directly from the graphical interface.
 
</ul>


All the data used by KiSThelP to get the thermochemistry results can be interactively changed directly from the KiSThelP graphical interface:


<ul>

<li> The Mass (amu).

<li> The potential energy (hartree).

<li> The Electronic degeneracy.

<li> The Rotational Symmetry number.

<li> The inertia moments (a.u.).

<li> The real vib. frequencies (cm-1).

</ul>

Also, a scaling factor applied to vib. frequencies can applied through the KiSThelP graphical interface. Default value in KiSThelP is 1.0.
